Vilmonic Translations
=====================

Vilmonic is an **artificial life simulator** and **genetics and evolution sandbox game**. Protect and breed unique pixel-art life forms where pixels and color have meaning. Experiment with natural and artificial selection. Craft tools and buildings and change the environment. Find ancient tech and fend off the mindless haywire zombitons.

**This repository is for localizing and translating the game.** If you would like to add a translation in a language that you are fluent in, please contact me: vilmonic@bludgeonsoft.org
